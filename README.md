## Getting and Cleaning Data, Coursera Session #011
## Course Project Repository

This repository contains the script <b>run_analysis.R</b>, which requires as input:
* access to the dplyr, tidyr, and reshape2 packages; 
* user-provided location of the desired working directory; and
* the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">UCI HAR Dataset</a> (downloaded on 14 February 2015), stored in a working directory subfolder of the same name.

The script generates a single output file called <i>tidy_final.txt</i>, which is stored to the working directory. 

This repository also contains the markdown file <b>CodeBook.md</b>, which describes the contents and derivation of the tidy_final.txt dataset.
