# getting-cleaning-data
##Repository for the course project of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data session #011

This repository contains a single script called run_analysis.R. 

The script requires as input:
* access to the dplyr, tidyr, and reshape2 packages; 
* user-provided location of the desired working directory; and
* the <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">UCI HAR Dataset</a> (downloaded on 14 February 2015), stored in a working directory subfolder of the same name.

The script generates a single output file called tidy_final.txt, which is stored to the working directory.
