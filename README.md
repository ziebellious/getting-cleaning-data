## Getting and Cleaning Data, Coursera Session #011: Course Project Repository

This repository contains the script **run_analysis.R**, which requires as input:
* pre-installation of the dplyr, tidyr, and reshape2 packages; and 
* the [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) (downloaded on 14 February 2015), stored in a working directory subfolder of the same name.

The script generates a single output file called *tidy_final.txt*, which is stored to the working directory. 

This repository also contains the markdown file **CodeBook.md**, which describes the contents and derivation of the tidy_final.txt dataset.
